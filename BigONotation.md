## Estimating g(x) given f(x)

(1)f(x) = n + log2n O(g(x)) =

(2)f(x) = n2+ log n4 O(g(x)) =

(3)f(x) = n2\*n3 O(g(x)) =

(4)f(x) = n5/n2 O(g(x)) =

(5)f(x) = n*(log n)*n O(g(x)) =

(6)f(x) = n + n log n + log n O(g(x)) =

## Counting Operations to produce polynomials

f(x) = 1

f(x) = 3n^2 + 2

f(x) = 2n + 1

f(x) = 3n + 2

## More Advanced Practice

Binary Search: g(x) = binary search is log b/c it cuts the data set in half each iteration

Bubble Sort: g(x) = n^2. worst case is that you have to iterative through the array n times, on which in each iteration you scan n elements.
