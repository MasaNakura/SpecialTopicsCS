## Estimating g(x) given f(x)

(1)f(x) = n + log2n           
O(g(x)) = O(n)

(2)f(x) = n^2 + log n^4       
O(g(x)) = O(n^2)

(3)f(x) = n^2 \* n^3

O(g(x)) = O(n^5)

(4)f(x) = n^5/n^2

O(g(x)) = O(n^3)

(5)f(x) = n*(log n)\* n 

O(g(x)) = O(n^2 \* log n)

(6)f(x) = n + n log n + log n 

O(g(x)) = O(n log n)

## Counting Operations to produce polynomials

f(x) = 1

f(x) = 3n^2 + 2

f(x) = 2n + 1

f(x) = 3n + 2

## More Advanced Practice

Binary Search: g(x) = binary search is log b/c it cuts the data set in half each iteration

Bubble Sort: g(x) = n^2. worst case is that you have to iterative through the array n times, on which in each iteration you scan n elements.
